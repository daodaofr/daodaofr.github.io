### Opening Positions
We have two positions (two Master) open for 2022 Fall in the AI Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Looking for self-motivated students working with me in computer vision. For prospective students, please send your resume and transcript to my email.


### Biography

Since May. 2021, I am a tenure-track assistant professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I received my PhD degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2019, supervised by Professor Xiaokang Yang and Professor Bingbing Ni. I received B. E. from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2013. I was a research scientist at the Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence (IIAI) from June 2019 to April 2021.

I am interested in **computer vision** and machine learning problems. Typically, I am working on (1) Person Re-identification;  (2) Image/video generation (3) Activity prediction; and (4) Face recognition.


### Updates

-05/2021  I join the AI Institute of Shanghai Jiao Tong University as an assistant professor.
-11/2020  I receive the Excellent Doctoral Dissertation Award from CSIG.
