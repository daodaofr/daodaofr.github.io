### Opening Positions
We have one PhD (co-supervise with Prof. Xiaokang Yang) and one Master open for 2023 Fall, in Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Looking for self-motivated students working with me in computer vision. For prospective students, please send your resume and transcript to my email.


### Biography

Since May. 2021, I am a tenure-track assistant professor at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://www.sjtu.edu.cn). I received my PhD degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2019, supervised by Professor [Xiaokang Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yDEavdMAAAAJ&hl=en). I received M. E. from [École Centrale de Lyon](https://www.ec-lyon.fr/) in France. I received B. E. from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2013. I was a research scientist at the [Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence (IIAI)](https://www.inceptioniai.org/) from June 2019 to April 2021.

I am interested in **computer vision** and machine learning problems. Typically, I am working on (1） Neural rendering （2） Domain adaptation/generalization (3) Person Re-identification  (4) Image/video generation (5) Action recognition.
